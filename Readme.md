# Advanced House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. It uses advanced data analytics techniques to process and analyze housing data, creating accurate price predictions through regression modeling.

## Data Analysis
- Dataset contains multiple features affecting house prices
- Total shape: Includes both numerical and categorical variables
- Focus on key price indicators through feature analysis

## Key Features

### Data Processing
- Separation of numerical and categorical features
- Identification of continuous variables (features with >25 unique values)
- Discrete variable analysis through median price comparisons

### Visualization
- Bar plots for discrete variables against sale prices
- Histogram analysis for continuous features
- Distribution analysis of price trends

### Model Implementation
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model training and validation
- Prediction generation on test data
